## Challenge description

<!--- Look at the challenge description, understand the goal of the challenge
and write it here with your own words. Use images if they improve the explanation--->

> In this competition, you’ll develop AI systems to efficiently learn new skills and solve open-ended problems, rather than depend exclusively on systems trained with extensive datasets. The top submissions will show improvement toward human level reasoning.

Create a system that is able to efficiently learn to do new tasks. It's all about efficiency because we don't have as much compute as OpenAI had when they announced o3.

## Evaluation

<!--- Understand the metric used on the challenge, write it here and study
the characteristics of the metric --->

> This competition evaluates submissions on the percentage of correct predictions. For each task, you should make 2 attempts to predict the exact outputs for every test input grid contained in the task. (Tasks can have more than one test input that needs a predicted output.) Each task test output has one ground truth. For a given task output, any of the 2 predicted outputs matches the ground truth exactly, you score 1 for that task test output, otherwise 0. The final score is the sum averaged of the highest score per task output divided by the total number of task test outputs.

## Assess situation

<!---This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources,
constraints, assumptions, and other factors that should be considered in determining
the data analysis goal and project plan

* timeline. Is there any week where I could not work on the challenge?
* resources. Is there any other project competing for resources?
* other projects. May I have other more interesting projects in the horizon?

The challenge ends on 4-11-2025, so we have 7 months to try new ideas. The grand prize is 700k$, whereas the progress prize would be 75k$ in the best case scenario (25k$ first prize and 50k$ best paper). So the prizes are designed to encourage the development of new and bold approaches.

At Veridas I can devote half of the time to the ARC challenge, and use the compute resources from the cluster. I could also use up to 15k$ in cloud computing if needed.

We can make one submission a day that it is worth 50$ in compute, that would be around 10k$ for all the competition. I believe I should use it as much as possible to gain information. Maybe I could use the development set as my test set and the public test set as my validation set.
However be aware that making a lot of submissions could prevent joining other people later in the competition.

## Terminology

<!--- Sometimes the field of the challenge has specific terms, if that is the
case write them here, otherwise delete this section.--->

## Questions

<!--- Write here any question that arises when reading about the challenge --->

## Project Plan

<!--- Write initial ideas for the project. This is just initial thoughts,
during the challenge I will have a better understanding of the project and
with better information I could decide other actions not considered here.--->
