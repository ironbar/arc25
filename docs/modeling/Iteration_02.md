# Iteration 2. Architects solution with 8 data splits

_04-04-2025_

## Goal

Can I improve the leaderboard score by doing 8 splits to the data instead of 4?

## Motivation

I believe that one of the reasons that my adaptation of the architects code is scoring higher than expected is that I'm using 4 data splits instead of the original 2 splits. On this iteration I want to see if 8 splits give even better results, if that is the case I will study how
to do an arbitrary number of splits (ideally equal to the number of tasks).
