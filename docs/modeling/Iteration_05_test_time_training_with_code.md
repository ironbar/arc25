# Iteration 5. Test-time training with code

_04-05-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Explore if test-time training is helpful when generating code:

- Hindsight experience replay
- Reinforcement learning
- Data augmentation

## Motivation

My idea is to pick a simple case that the model is not able to solve, all vertical lines with all the colors. I first have to verify that the model is unable to solve it. Then check
if any of my ideas allows the model to solve.

## Development

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Find a simple task that the model is not able to solve
- [ ] Does Hindsight experience replay helps to learn to do the task?
- [ ] Does RL helps?
- [ ] Is data augmentation helpful?
