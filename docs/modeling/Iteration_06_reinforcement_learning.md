# Iteration 6. Reinforcement learning

_08-05-2025_

## Goal

Can we use RL to solve novel tasks?

## Motivation

I have already seen that Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is helpful to adapt a model to new tasks. On
this iteration I want to try with RL, specifically with the popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.

Probably the best option is a combination of the two approaches, but first I have to find if GRPO is helpful.
I would also like to see how it compares with HER in terms of efficiency.

## Development

[TRL](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/grpo_trainer) has already implemented GRPO, so testing it will be very easy.

I will be doing the experiments on the notebook [005_GRPO_exploration](../../notebooks/005_GRPO_exploration.ipynb)
