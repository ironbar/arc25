# Iteration 8. Improve HER

_10-05-2025_

## Goal

Can I optimize HER to draw a chick?

## Motivation

I have already probed that HER can solve a task with 25 squares, but can it solve arbitrary images?

The idea is to optimize the algorithm and the parameters so it is able to draw the chick of the image above. If I can do that I will be confident to the next step that will be extend the DSL.

## Development

I will be working on this notebook [006_HER_v2](../../notebooks/006_HER_v2.ipynb)
