# Iteration 10. Solve ARC tasks

_22-05-2025_

## Goal

Can I solve real ARC tasks with code and HER?

## Motivation

I have already seen that HER allows to generalize to novel toy tasks, I need to check if it can solve
real ARC tasks.

I know that my primitive functions defined on ARC24 solved 285 training tasks. So probably the easiest
path is to review those transformations add them and modify if needed.

## Development

### Add safety and determinism checks

Inspired by [Absolute Zero Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) I'm going
add safety and determinism checks.

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [x] Add safety and determinism checks
- [ ] Add more primitive functions and training tasks to learn to use them
