# Iteration 10. Solve ARC tasks

_18-05-2025_

## Goal

Can I solve real ARC tasks with code and HER?

## Motivation

I have already seen that HER allows to generalize to novel toy tasks, I need to check if it can solve
real ARC tasks.

## Development

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Add safety and determinism checks
