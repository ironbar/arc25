# Iteration 10. Solve ARC tasks

_22-05-2025_

## Goal

Can I solve real ARC tasks with code and HER?

## Motivation

I have already seen that HER allows to generalize to novel toy tasks, I need to check if it can solve
real ARC tasks.

I know that my primitive functions defined on ARC24 solved 285 training tasks. So probably the easiest
path is to review those transformations add them and modify if needed.
