# Iteration 12. Solve a few ARC tasks

_17-06-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Probe that I can solve a few selected ARC tasks by using an LLM to write code.

## Motivation

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Write new training tasks to solve the current knowledge gaps of the model
- [ ] I need a way to do evaluation at scale, using multiple GPUs, and saving all the generated tasks when searching for a solution.
- [ ] If possible I should use Kaggle compute for evaluation. It is almost free and is a good way to store and visualize results.
- [ ] Compositionality, can the model solve the task that selects the biggest object, crop and trim? That
  would be a good example of compositionality because those functions were not used together in the dataset
- [ ] Sequential solving. Try also solving the tasks in multiple steps, not just once. It could help
  with compositionality.
