## Goal

Define the solution I want to implement in the following months.

## Search and Learn

Search and learn are the two mechanisms to adapt to novelty, and I bet that to beat ARC we need both.
Thus my proposal for ARC25 is a system that is able to explore the program space of the solutions and
learn during the exploration.
