# Iteration 18. Refine Solution

_31-07-2025_

## Goal

Experiment with solution refinement with base models. Does it improve over simply sampling the model
multiple times?

## Motivation

I'm still exploring the search strategy to find solutions for ARC. In [SOAR](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/43499) and on Ryan Greenblatt
solution the model was able to refine the functions and that was beneficial. I want to verify that
I can also do it.
