# Iteration 19. Search with BARC

_18/08/2025_

## Goal

Use the induction model from Boostrapping ARC (BARC) to search code solutions. This will stablish
a baseline score that could be later be used to explore methods to improve the efficiency of the search.

## Motivation

I believe I can validate my ideas using the model from BARC. That saves me the process of generating
a DSL and training a model on it. Later if I validate my ideas and find that the DSL is incomplete, I
could devote to the task of creating the ultimate DSL. But first I have to validate that we can
improve dramatically the accuracy of an induction model by learning from the search results.
