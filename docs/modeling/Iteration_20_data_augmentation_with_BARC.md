# Iteration 20. Data augmentation with BARC

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Does using data augmentation increases the diversity of the predictions and improves the pass@n metric?

## Motivation

On a previous [iteration with base models](Iteration_17_increase_search_diversity.md) I found that
data augmentation was not helpful. That result was weird, so I want to repeat the experiments with BARC.
