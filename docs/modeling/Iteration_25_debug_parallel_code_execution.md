# Iteration 25. Debug parallel code execution

_16-09-2025_

## Goal

Solve the problems of slow parallel code execution in the cluster.

## Motivation

I have a method that executes code in parallel and works very fast on my computer and on Kaggle, but
weirdly it is slow on the cluster. I need to solve this issue to be able to do experiments
to validate my approach.
