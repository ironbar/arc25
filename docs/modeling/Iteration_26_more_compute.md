# Iteration 26. Acquire more compute

_23-09-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Acquire more compute to be able to do experiments before the end of the competition

## Motivation

Currently we have 13xA6000 GPUs and 2xH100 GPUs in Veridas' cluster. However we are going to loose
half of the A6000 due to problems with the machine so competition for the hardware will be fierce.

It's time to use the compute offered by ARC prize partners to be able to do my experiments.

## Development

https://arcprize.org/partners

- [x] Strong Compute. $5k-$50k. 
- [x] Lambda. $1K. Applied and received 1k in compute credits.
- [ ] Google. $?. Applied, waiting for approval
- [ ] Hyperbolic. $1K. . Applied, waiting for approval
- [ ] Modal. $500. Already applied, waiting for approval
- RunPod. $100. Decided not to apply.

### Strong Compute

I did the introductory call on 29/09/2025. My initial intention is to use machines with 3090 to run
experiments with search and learn and find the best possible configuration.
