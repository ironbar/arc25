_start date_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

We already know that search and learn works. Can we make it faster and better?

## Motivation

## Development

### Speed analysis of all the parts

TODO: the goal is to measure where the execution time is going so I can have more information to design improvements

- Probably the easiest way to do it is to use the logs from Kaggle.
- I can also use the logs from the cluster experiments

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps

## TODO

- [ ] Maybe I should discard the idea of tuning for each task independently if the data shows that it is too inefficient
  - [ ] Edit the script to support grouping tasks
  - [ ] Compare speed of grouping vs no grouping
