# Iteration 2x. Refine predictions

_start date_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Study if asking the model to refine its prediction is helpful

## Motivation

All the evolutionary search approaches use the model to refine its most promising solutions.

I want to explore:

1. Does the GPU 25GB VRAM allow to do prediction refine with BARC induction model?
2. How much improvement do we get compared to doing independent predictions?
