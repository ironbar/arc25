# Iteration 29. Multi-gpu RL

_04-10-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Can I train a model with RL and multiple GPUs?

## Motivation

The current unsloth implementation is able to train at around 3k-5k steps per day depending on the
number of generations. To be able to train faster I want to try to use multiple GPUs for training.

Current BARC induction model is not strong enough to solve ARC, it needs a lot of RL training.
