# Iteration 30. Solve RL Collapse

_05-10-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

I need to solve RL collapse issues so I can train for longer and get a more powerful base model.

## Motivation

I have already seen improvements in model capabilities after training with RL on [iteration 24](Iteration_24_RL_BARC.md),
but when training for longer the reward collapsed.

I need to understand the problem and fix it so I can train for longer on more data.
