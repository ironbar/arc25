# Iteration 31. How to improve from 20% to 100%?

_12-10-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Think how to improve from 20% to 100% on the ARC-AGI-1 evaluation set.

## Motivation

So far we have verified that we can use hindsight relabel to adapt the model to new tasks and
increase the ARC score. However the BARC induction model is only solving ~20% of the ARC-AGI-1 evaluation
set, and around 1% of the ARC-AGI-2 evaluation set. This model is not capable of solving ARC with
the compute constraints of the submission.

We need to think outside the box to be able to make a dramatic improvement.
