# Iteration 32. Analyze model predictions

_12-10-2025_

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.

## Goal

Analyze model predictions to understand the accuracy. Why is only solving ~20% of the ARC-AGI-1 evaluation tasks.

## Motivation

To be able to improve I need to understand why it does not solve the tasks.

## Development

Using predictions from previous experiments, I need to create a notebook to select the most accurate predictions and visualize them. I will do a random sampling of the unsolved tasks to diagnose the problems.

## Results

## Conclusion

## Next steps
